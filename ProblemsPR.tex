\subsection{Problems}
No permission to use partial reconfiguration feature in Quartus Software.
Get a new license which allows us to use the feature but our Cyclone V FPGA is not supporting this
feature. A more special FPGA is required which is not affordable.\\
\textbf{status quo - cancellation of the poject}\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item literature survey
  \item top level design
  \item static region $\rightarrow$ ticker (still runing while reconfiguration)
  \item pr region $\rightarrow$ two different LED pattern; persona A, persona B
  \item wrapper design 
\end{itemize}
