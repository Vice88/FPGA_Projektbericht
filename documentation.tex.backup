\section{Partial reconfiguration}
\subsection{Idea of partial reconfiguration}
A field programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit which can handle digital logic. This circuit can be configured to handle the desired function. 
The reconfiguration is done by an external pc which programs the fpga. The idea of the partial reconfiguration is, that a part of the fpga will work continuously while the other part is reconfigured, reprogrammed.
This reconfiguration should be done by an external processor on the development kit which initates the reconfiguration und programs the desired locig cells of the fpga while the other part remains in its process.
The intiation is done by an internal host which runs a C/C++ programm. This C/C++ programm is stored in the RAM (read access memory) of the development kit board.

\subsection{Implementation}
Software used on the Altera Cyclone V FPGA (5SCEMA5F31C6N) on DE1-SoC: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Quartus II Version 14.1/15.0 (Windows 7/8.1)
  
 
\end{enumerate}


% \subsubsection{software code}

% \include{ProblemsPR}
\subsection{Problems}
No permission to use partial reconfiguration feature in Quartus Software.
Get a new license which allows us to use the feature but our Cyclone V FPGA is not supporting this
feature. A more special FPGA is required which is not affordable.\\
\textbf{status quo - cancellation of the poject}\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item literature survey
  \item top level design
  \item static region $\rightarrow$ ticker (still runing while reconfiguration)
  \item pr region $\rightarrow$ two different LED pattern; persona A, persona B
  \item wrapper design 
\end{itemize}

% \include{DiscussionPR}
\subsection{Discussion}
partial reconfiguration could be a good thing, but the opinions differ a lot. some say it is only
the work for univesity in resarch fields but not in industry. pro vs. contra arguments to be
stated here.
