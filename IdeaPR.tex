\section{Partial reconfiguration}
\subsection{Idea of partial reconfiguration}
the reconfiguration should be partial, so that a part of the fpga do not stop the process and the
other part will be reconfigured. reconfiguration with internal host. run a C/C++ programm on hard
processor of the board to initiate the partial reconfiguration. hadware-processor-system get a C/C++ programm out of a RAM
to initiate the partial reconfiguartion. partial reconfiguration means only a part of the FPGA
will reconfigured while another part of the FPGA will still running. the partial reconfiguration
only change a part of the LAB.
